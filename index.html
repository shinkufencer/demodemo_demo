	SCENE. Verona. A public place.</p>
<p>
	(Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers)<br />
	SAMPSON<br />
	Gregory, o&#39; my word, we&#39;ll not carry coals.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	I mean, an we be in choler, we&#39;ll draw.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o&#39; the collar.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	I strike quickly, being moved.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:<br />
	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn&#39;st away.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will<br />
	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague&#39;s.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes<br />
	to the wall.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,<br />
	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push<br />
	Montague&#39;s men from the wall, and thrust his maids<br />
	to the wall.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	&#39;Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I<br />
	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the<br />
	maids, and cut off their heads.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	The heads of the maids?</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;<br />
	take it in what sense thou wilt.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and<br />
	&#39;tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	&#39;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou<br />
	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes<br />
	two of the house of the Montagues.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	How! turn thy back and run?</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Fear me not.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	No, marry; I fear thee!</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as<br />
	they list.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;<br />
	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>
<p>
	(Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR)</p>
<p>
	ABRAHAM<br />
	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p>
	ABRAHAM<br />
	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say<br />
	ay?</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	No.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I<br />
	bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	Do you quarrel, sir?</p>
<p>
	ABRAHAM<br />
	Quarrel sir! no, sir.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</p>
<p>
	ABRAHAM<br />
	No better.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Well, sir.</p>
<p>
	GREGORY<br />
	Say &#39;better:&#39; here comes one of my master&#39;s kinsmen.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Yes, better, sir.</p>
<p>
	ABRAHAM<br />
	You lie.</p>
<p>
	SAMPSON<br />
	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.</p>
<p>
	(They fight)</p>
<p>
	(Enter BENVOLIO)</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Part, fools!<br />
	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</p>
<p>
	(Beats down their swords)</p>
<p>
	(Enter TYBALT)</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br />
	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<br />
	Or manage it to part these men with me.</p>
<p>
	TYBALT<br />
	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,<br />
	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:<br />
	Have at thee, coward!</p>
<p>
	(They fight)</p>
<p>
	(Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs)</p>
<p>
	First Citizen<br />
	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!<br />
	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</p>
<p>
	(Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET)</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</p>
<p>
	LADY CAPULET<br />
	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</p>
<p>
	CAPULET<br />
	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,<br />
	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</p>
<p>
	(Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE)</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	Thou villain Capulet,&mdash;Hold me not, let me go.</p>
<p>
	LADY MONTAGUE<br />
	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</p>
<p>
	(Enter PRINCE, with Attendants)</p>
<p>
	PRINCE<br />
	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br />
	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,&mdash;<br />
	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br />
	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br />
	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br />
	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br />
	Throw your mistemper&#39;d weapons to the ground,<br />
	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br />
	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br />
	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br />
	Have thrice disturb&#39;d the quiet of our streets,<br />
	And made Verona&#39;s ancient citizens<br />
	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br />
	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br />
	Canker&#39;d with peace, to part your canker&#39;d hate:<br />
	If ever you disturb our streets again,<br />
	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br />
	For this time, all the rest depart away:<br />
	You Capulet; shall go along with me:<br />
	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br />
	To know our further pleasure in this case,<br />
	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br />
	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO)</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br />
	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Here were the servants of your adversary,<br />
	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:<br />
	I drew to part them: in the instant came<br />
	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,<br />
	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br />
	He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br />
	Who nothing hurt withal hiss&#39;d him in scorn:<br />
	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br />
	Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br />
	Till the prince came, who parted either part.</p>
<p>
	LADY MONTAGUE<br />
	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?<br />
	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Madam, an hour before the worshipp&#39;d sun<br />
	Peer&#39;d forth the golden window of the east,<br />
	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<br />
	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<br />
	That westward rooteth from the city&#39;s side,<br />
	So early walking did I see your son:<br />
	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me<br />
	And stole into the covert of the wood:<br />
	I, measuring his affections by my own,<br />
	That most are busied when they&#39;re most alone,<br />
	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,<br />
	And gladly shunn&#39;d who gladly fled from me.</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br />
	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.<br />
	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br />
	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br />
	Should in the furthest east begin to draw<br />
	The shady curtains from Aurora&#39;s bed,<br />
	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,<br />
	And private in his chamber pens himself,<br />
	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out<br />
	And makes himself an artificial night:<br />
	Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br />
	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	I neither know it nor can learn of him.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Have you importuned him by any means?</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	Both by myself and many other friends:<br />
	But he, his own affections&#39; counsellor,<br />
	Is to himself&mdash;I will not say how true&mdash;<br />
	But to himself so secret and so close,<br />
	So far from sounding and discovery,<br />
	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,<br />
	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,<br />
	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br />
	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.<br />
	We would as willingly give cure as know.</p>
<p>
	(Enter ROMEO)</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;<br />
	I&#39;ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</p>
<p>
	MONTAGUE<br />
	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,<br />
	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let&#39;s away.</p>
<p>
	(Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE)</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Good-morrow, cousin.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Is the day so young?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	But new struck nine.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Ay me! sad hours seem long.<br />
	Was that my father that went hence so fast?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo&#39;s hours?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	In love?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Out&mdash;</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Of love?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Out of her favour, where I am in love.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,<br />
	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,<br />
	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!<br />
	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br />
	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br />
	Here&#39;s much to do with hate, but more with love.<br />
	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br />
	O any thing, of nothing first create!<br />
	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br />
	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br />
	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,<br />
	sick health!<br />
	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!<br />
	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br />
	Dost thou not laugh?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	No, coz, I rather weep.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Good heart, at what?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	At thy good heart&#39;s oppression.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Why, such is love&#39;s transgression.<br />
	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br />
	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br />
	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown<br />
	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br />
	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;<br />
	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers&#39; eyes;<br />
	Being vex&#39;d a sea nourish&#39;d with lovers&#39; tears:<br />
	What is it else? a madness most discreet,<br />
	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.<br />
	Farewell, my coz.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Soft! I will go along;<br />
	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;<br />
	This is not Romeo, he&#39;s some other where.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Groan! why, no.<br />
	But sadly tell me who.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:<br />
	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!<br />
	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	I aim&#39;d so near, when I supposed you loved.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	A right good mark-man! And she&#39;s fair I love.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	Well, in that hit you miss: she&#39;ll not be hit<br />
	With Cupid&#39;s arrow; she hath Dian&#39;s wit;<br />
	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm&#39;d,<br />
	From love&#39;s weak childish bow she lives unharm&#39;d.<br />
	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<br />
	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,<br />
	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:<br />
	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,<br />
	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,<br />
	For beauty starved with her severity<br />
	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br />
	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br />
	To merit bliss by making me despair:<br />
	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br />
	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	O, teach me how I should forget to think.</p>
<p>
	BENVOLIO<br />
	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;<br />
	Examine other beauties.</p>
<p>
	ROMEO<br />
	&#39;Tis the way<br />
	To call hers exquisite, in question more:<br />
	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#39; brows<br />
	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;<br />
	He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br />
	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:<br />
	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br />
	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note<br />
	Where I may read who pass&#39;d that passing fair?<br />
	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</p>
